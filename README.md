### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My nickname is **Nenyoko Nero** and welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a high school student in France and I'm impressed by computer science and everything it can do. My favourite language is C. I'm still learning a lot and hope one day to contribute to the open-source community.
If you want to contact me, feel free to join [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/U3RFgUQ6bD)! âœ¨
